title: Javascript Processor
---

This is one of my biggest projects I have ever done. It is a reduced lexic, syntactic and semtatic processor of a modified version of Javascript where you give it a source javascript file and it returns if the file is well written. In case of failure, it will give you the lines where the error is and the mistakes you did, like a usual compiler.

### Symbols

There are a few aritmethic and logic symbols that I implemented:

* Assignment (=) 
* Modular assignment (%=)
* Minus (-)
* Minor than (<)
* Negation (!)

Apart of this, thare are the essential symbols like round and curly brackets, double slash for commenting lines, single quotes for string variables and so on.

### Variables, decisions and loops

Here we declare some of this modified javascript language types, some predefined functions and statements and functions.

* int, boolean, string
* print, input
* if, for
* function
